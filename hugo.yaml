    content: |
     I am a Researcher, Scientist and Research Software Engineer (RSE) specialized in applying machine learning to material science. My background is in mechanics of granular matter complemented by experience on improving software practices in research. At the Netherlands eScience center in Amsterdam I currently collaborate with researchers across various domains to enhance the scientific landscape by means of better software.

     I believe in Open Science and try to advocate for it by sharing the source code of my projects and contributing to open-source libraries and projects.

          As an RSE at NLeSC I collaborate with researchers to develop eScience tools that enhance their research.
          I am part of the Natural Sciences section and  [team Nabla \\( \\nabla \\)](https://github.com/Team-Nabla) working on projects involving Machine Learning and materials science.

          Projects I have contributed to:

          - [GrainLearning](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/granular-materials): Neural networks as surrogates for simulation parameters inference.
          - [OnSET](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/et-apps): Improving software practices for an efficient and robust open-source modelling platform for research on Energy Transition applications.

          At [GRASP (Group of Research and Application in Statistical Physics)](https://www.grasp.uliege.be/cms/c_5158228/en/grasp), I was part of [AEROPERF](https://www.chemeng.uliege.be/cms/c_5024355/en/aeroperf) a multidisciplinary team focusing on the development and optimization of inhalation powders. These powders were engineered for effective pulmonary drug delivery, ensuring deep and homogeneous distribution in the lungs. My role involved the physical characterization of these spray-dried powders, specifically examining their agglomeration to improve flowability. Additionally, I conducted experiments and simulations on air fluidized beds, contributing to a deeper understanding of physical mechanisms crucial in various industrial applications.

          Modelling and characterizing granular flows in rotating drums and to elucidate the mechanisms of particle grinding across scales. By means of particle dynamics simulations and a breakage model involving the tessellation of particles and a dynamic debonding criterion based on fracture mechanics, I investigated single-particle impacts, the properties of granular flows in the cascading regime in a rotating drum as a function of system parameters, the effect of the size and amount of grinding media on the grinding process, and the evolution of particle breakage in flows of breakable particles.

          I performed experimental studies on the effects of hydrophobic particles on water migration in fine graded soils. This project was in the framework of a collaboration between the Universidad de los Andes and the Government of Vichada, Colombia. The goal was to improve the soil properties of the region to enable the construction of roads and other infrastructure.
